# Just a late-night project on my raspbery pi 2

I'm trying to see where my new fish swim in my tank and whether or not adding a bubble machine changes their behavior.

I'm suspecting that my water pump is not powerful enough to get enough oxygen into the water... hopefully we see something fun! :D

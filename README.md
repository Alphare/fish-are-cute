# Just a late-night project on my raspbery pi 2

I'm trying to see where my new fish swim in my tank and whether or not adding a bubble machine changes their behavior.

I'm suspecting that my water pump is not powerful enough to get enough oxygen into the water... hopefully we see something fun! :D

# Installing

Either use the old-style requirements.txt or:

Install Pyenv using Pyenv-installer
Install Python 3.6.4: `pyenv install 3.6.4`
`cd <BASE_DIR>`
Install Pipenv using the Python you just installed (using the .python-version file): `pip install pipenv`
Run `pipenv install`
Enjoy.
